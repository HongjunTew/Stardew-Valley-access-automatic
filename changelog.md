stardew automatic, v1.0 instable version.
Hello everybody! I'm coming here to tell you that the script has had a new update!
1. added the kokoro mod, the missing mod for the game to work with the screen reader.
The cause of the problem was detected in the SMAPI console.
2. Added the possibility for you to create a desktop shortcut.
3. added the possibility for you to enable game achievements.
4. To run the game with the achievements, run it directly from the desktop.
if you run the game directly with the script, achievements are not supported
5. SMAPI updated to new version 4.0.1 and all other mods updated.
6. Added automatic fishing and movable glue in the new version, although they may not work due to incompatibility with the new SMAPI.
PS: it didn't work for me.
Have a good game.
